/// Object implementing the Best Master Clock Algorithm
///
/// Usage:
///
/// - Every port has its own instance.
/// - When a port receives an announce message, it has to register it with the [Bmca::register_announce_message] method
/// - When it is time to run the algorithm, the ptp runtime has to take all the best announce messages using [Bmca::take_best_port_announce_message]
/// - Of the resulting set, the best global one needs to be determined. This can be done using [Bmca::find_best_announce_message]
/// - Then to get the recommended state for each port, [Bmca::calculate_recommended_state] needs to be called
